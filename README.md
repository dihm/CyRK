# CyRK
Runge-Kutta ODE Integrator Implemented in Cython and Numba


## Installation
In order to install `CyRK` you must have the [numpy](https://numpy.org/) and [cython](https://cython.org/) packages installed (CyRK will attempt to install these if they are not present). It is recommended you pre-install these in an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) environment.

Once you are ready to install navigate to the directory containing CyRK's `setup.py` file and run the command:

`python -m pip install -e . --upgrade --force-reinstall -v`

This will create a dynamic (editable) link to the CyRK directory so that future updates can be more easily installed.
