# CyRK - Change Log

## 2022 - December

### v0.2.0 - Alpha

Bug Fixes
- Fixed issues with the metadata provided by pyproject.toml.
- `cyrk_ode` fixes
  - Fixed bug that was causing the ubuntu slowdown and likely other errors
  - Added a `cabs` absolute value function to ensure that complex numbers are being properly handled when `abs()` is called.
- `nbrk_ode` fixes
  - Fixed warning during numba integration about contiguous arrays.

Performance Improvements
- `cyrk_ode` improvements
  - Integrator now selects an output message based on the status code rather than building a string during the integration loop.
  - Switched the loop order for the final list to ndarray conversion. Before the time domain was being redundantly built y_size times.

Other Changes
- pyproject.toml provides more constrained package list rather than an open search.
- Added back ubuntu tests and publishes to GitHub workflows.

### v0.1.3 - Alpha

- Fixed a broken example in the readme documentation.
- Added better quick tests for both the numba and cython versions.
- Added `SciPy` dependency that was missing (required for numba integrator).
- Increased the lower limit on `numpy` package version (to fix issue [7](https://github.com/jrenaud90/CyRK/issues/7)) and removed the upper limit version.
- Removed python 3.7 as a supported version. 
- Updated graphic in readme.
- Converted over to using `pyproject.toml` instead of `setup.py`
  - removed `version.py` from project folder.
